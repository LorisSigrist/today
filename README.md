# TODAY

A demo of how to redeploy an application based on a CRON-Job, using Github Actions.
Every day at 00:00, the application is redeployed.

If this is still working, then [this site](https://LorisSigrist.github.io/today) will show the current date.

Read `.github/workflows/main.yml` for details information.
